Title: QAM Transmission and Receiver System

Description: In this project, an audio file would be transmitted through a QAM scheme and the receiver would receive the signal and demodulate it. White/Gaussian Noise would also be added to make the TX-RX system closer to real-life systems. The receiver would recover the audio file input with plausible data. 

Rationale: The proponents aim to create the Tx - Rx QAM system to understand more about Digital Communications. As described, the system is not noiseless and the challenge is recovering the signal with plausible audio. To make things different from the internet, the students would not use Simulink or any built-in application from MATLAB.  

Features: 
Able to accept “insert” input
